                            On the forecasting team, my main responsibilities lie in estimating future audiences of various programs across both CNN and competitive networks â€“ anywhere from days to years ahead of time. To this end, I blend historical data, primary research, and develop various machine learning models in R to both create and evaluate estimates. Additionally, I built and maintained custom shiny dashboards to quickly convey important information to key stakeholders.

                                Day to day, I was responsible for creating and sharing daily audience delivery and reach reports. These reports were created out of Nielsen data, accessed through the Nielsen suite of tools and products. As a summer-long project, I also designed and built a custom Shiny app to track different network deliveries per market demographic over time.
